# Tomasulo Algorithm Simulator (Java & Swing)

Clone it and then open in Eclipse IDE and run "src\Simulation.java" (make sure to extend the window if the buttons at the bottom do not appear when data is being displayed).

Simple Tomasulo algorithm created using Java with very simple UI using Swing just to implement the idea of Tomasulo.

Tomasulo's algorithm is a computer architecture hardware algorithm for dynamic scheduling of instructions that allows out-of-order execution and enables more efficient use of multiple execution units.
