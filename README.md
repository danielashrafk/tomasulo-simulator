# Tomasulo Algorithm Simulator (Java & Swing)

Clone then open in eclipse and run "src\Simulation.java"

Simple Tomasulo algorithm created using Java with very simple UI using Swing just to implement the idea of Tomasulo.

Tomasulo's algorithm is a computer architecture hardware algorithm for dynamic scheduling of instructions that allows out-of-order execution and enables more efficient use of multiple execution units.
